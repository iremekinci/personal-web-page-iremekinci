üìç Personal Web Page ‚Äì ƒ∞rem Ekinci

This is a personal website created as part of the GMT458 Web GIS course assignment.
The website was designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and OpenLayers (OL) for interactive map functionalities.

üåê Features

Interactive Maps: Two OpenLayers maps showing my home city (Istanbul) and my university (Hacettepe, Ankara).

Visited Cities Map: Displays locations I‚Äôve traveled to across T√ºrkiye with clickable markers.

Coordinate Display: Shows live coordinates (longitude, latitude) when hovering over maps.

Light/Dark Mode: Users can switch between visual themes.

Scroll Navigation: Smooth section transitions with active header highlighting.

Responsive Design: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

üß† Learned from AI

Implementing base map switching (OSM / Toner / Satellite).

Designing smooth scrolling and section fade-in animations.

Setting up dark/light mode with local storage memory.

I searched online and then used AI (ChatGPT) for guidance, especially for:

Structuring the JavaScript functions for multiple maps.

Improving CSS layout and responsive design.

‚è±Ô∏è AI Usage

Approximate AI assistance time: 2-3 hours total.

I mainly used AI for:

Debugging OpenLayers layer problems.

Writing modern, consistent CSS.

Optimizing JavaScript for event handling.
